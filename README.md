# Utilities

> `utilities_example` was auto-generated by `helpis_cli`

## About The Project

--------------------

The aim of this project is to provide a range of examples for the functionality provided in the [utilities](https://github.com/helpisdev/utilities.git) package, the [adaptive_scaffold](https://github.com/helpisdev/scaffold.git), and the [helpis_cli](https://github.com/helpisdev/helpis_cli.git).

### ___Built With:___

[![Dart][Dart]][dart-url] [![Flutter][Flutter]][flutter-url]

## Getting Started

--------------------

The example has been developed and tested on `PopOS 22.04`, on a physical `android` device, and on the latest `google-chrome-stable` from the `apt` package repository on `linux`.

Known issues:

- The `just_audio` implementation for linux based on `mpv` has many bugs and malfunctions.
- There is no way to my knowledge to change the localization of `MediaItem`s that display song information on the android system (lock screen & notifications bar)

### Prerequisites

To install and build the project you have to have already installed __git__, and __flutter__.
You can find instructions on how to install those on their respected websites:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/helpisdev/utilities_example.git

## Usages

### The `lib/main.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`, `adaptive_scaffold`, and `helpis_cli`

#### From `utilities`

- `util.Platform` to check the platform (web, desktop, mobile)
- `util.usePathUrlStrategy()` to use path URLs on the web
- `util.ensureInitialized()` to initialize utilities dependencies
- `util.PermissionHandler` to request permissions

#### From `adaptive_scaffold`

- `AdaptiveScaffold` which provides a responsive layout for web, desktop and mobile
- `GTKManager` to initialize GTK on desktop

#### From `helpis_cli`

- Initializes the caching service generated with `helpis createStore`

### In `lib/src/configuration.dart`, the following features of `utilities` and `adaptive_scaffold` are being used

#### `adaptive_scaffold`

- `GoRouterAdaptiveScaffoldConfig` to configure the adaptive scaffold.
- `AdaptiveAppBar`, `AdaptiveScrollbarConfig` and `NavigationRailConfig` to configure the app bar, scrollbar and navigation rail respectively.

#### `utilities`

- `H4` from `utilities` to style the app bar title.
- `context.currentTheme` to get the current theme.

### In `lib/src/entry.dart`, the following features of `utilities`, `helpis_cli`, and `adaptive_scaffold` are being used

#### `utilities`

- `util.Localizations` is used to provide locale-specific resources to the app.
- `util.WebDragScrollBehavior()` is used as the scroll behavior for the `MaterialApp`. It enables drag-to-scroll behavior for web.
- `util.ScreenSizeProvider` is a widget used to provide the screen size to its child widget.
- The `ChangeLocalization` extension is used to change the locale of a `BuildContext`. It is called as `context.changeLocale(locale)`.

#### From `helpis_cli`, from commands `colorgen`, `createStore`, and `create`

- `storage` refers to the `StorageService` which is used to cache data in the app. It is used to store the locale, theme mode, and other settings.
- `Theming` is a widget used to provide theme data to its child widget. It uses the `ThemeProvider` to get the current theme.
- `ThemeProvider` is used to manage the light and dark themes, and switch between them. It is accessed using `ThemeProvider.of(context)`.

#### `adaptive_scaffold`

- `GTKLocalizations.delegate` is used to provide GTK-based localizations to the app.

### The `lib/src/gen/l10n/l10n.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`

- The `LocaleName` `typedef` to represent a locale nameas a `String`.
- The `LocalizationsProvider` to provide locale information to the `BuildContext`.
- The `Language` enum is used to represent the supported languages in the app. It currently has two options:
  - `EN` for English
  - `EL` for Greek
The `language` getter uses the `LocalizationsProvider` to get the currently selected `Language` based on the locale.

### The `lib/src/routes.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`

- The `ScreenRoute` class is used as a base class for all app routes in `lib/src/routes.dart`. It defines some common properties and methods for the routes:
  - `title()`: Returns the title for the route.
  - `builder`: Returns the widget builder for the route.

The actual app routes (like `OpeningRoute`, `SettingsRoute`, etc.) extend the `AppRoute` which extends `ScreenRoute` class and provide implementations for the `title()`, `builder` and extra methods defined in `AppRoute` like `navigate<T>()` methods.

So in summary, the `ScreenRoute` class defines a common interface/contract for all app routes, and the concrete route classes implement that interface.

### The `lib/src/screens/opening.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities` and `adaptive_scaffold`

#### From `utilities`

- `snackBar()` which is used to show a `SnackBar` with an action button.
- `Breakpoint` and `PredefinedBreakpoint` which are used to determine if the screen is being shown on mobile or desktop.
- `Platform` which is used to check if the platform is mobile or desktop.

#### From `adaptive_scaffold`

- `GoRouterAdaptiveScaffoldConfig` which is used to configure the `AdaptiveScaffold`.
- `GoRouterBodyConfig` which is used to configure the body of the `AdaptiveScaffold`.
- `StatelessScreen` which is the base screen class used. Extends `Screen`.
- `AdaptiveScaffold` which is the main scaffold widget used to handle responsiveness.

The `OpeningScreen` is using these widgets and utilities to show either a desktop layout with a radio player above the scaffold, or a mobile layout with the radio player below the scaffold. It also shows a `SnackBar` with an action button on desktop, and without an action button on mobile. The `OpeningScreen` is also a `StatefulScreenWidget`, a `Screen` without the enforcement of returning a `Screen` from `build`, that can also hold its own state.

### The `lib/src/screens/product_list.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`

- `LoadingShimmer`, which displays a shimmering loading effect while data is loading. It is used here as a placeholder while the `FutureBuilder` is waiting for the product data (mocked with a 3 second delay).
- `FadingListView`, which is a `ListView` that fades items in and out as they scroll on and off screen. It is used here to display the list of products, fading them in and out smoothly.
- `widthTransformer`, which is a utility function that calculates a width based on a percentage of the available width. It is used here to get 90% of the available width, and pass that to the `LoadingShimmer` as its width.

### The `lib/src/screens/settings.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities` and `helpis_cli`

#### From `utilities`

- `LabelLarge` is used to display the text for the language switch button. It is given a maximum of 3 lines and is center aligned.
- `BuildContext.changeLocale` is called to change the locale/language of the app. It is passed the new `Language` to change to.
- `StyledElevatedButton.icon` is used to create the language switch button. It displays an icon and label, and calls the onPressed method when tapped to change the language.

#### From `helpis_cli`

- `storage.write` is called to save the new locale's language code to cache using the `StorageKey.locale.name` key.

### The `lib/src/screens/product.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`

- `LeadParagraph`: Used to display the product description. It is a responsive text widget that adapts its font size based on the viewport size.
- `H2`, `H3`, `H4`: Used to display the product title. `H3` is used on mobile, `H2` on desktop. `H4` is used to display the formatted product price on mobile.
- `LabelSmall`: Used to display the product SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) on desktop.
- `ResizableText`: Used to format and display the product price. It is a responsive text widget that adapts its font size based on the viewport size.
- `Platform`: Used to check if the app is running on mobile or desktop and show/hide certain widgets accordingly.
- `BuildContext.currentTheme`: Used to get the current theme and use its colors for text, containers, etc.
- `Currency`: Represents the currency the product is priced in. Used to format the price correctly.
- `Currency.format`: Used to format the product price according to the currency. For example, $1.99 for USD, â‚¬1.99 for EUR.

### The `lib/src/widgets/radio/widgets/player_screen_builder.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities` and `adaptive_scaffold`

#### From `utilities`

- `produceValOrNull`: This is a utility function that takes a producer function and an input value. It will call the producer function if the input value is non-null, and return the produced value. Otherwise it returns `null`. It is used here to optionally configure an `AdaptiveScaffoldConfig` if one is passed in.
- `produceT1fromT2orNull`: This is similar to `produceValOrNull` but converts from one type to another. It is used here to optionally convert a `Scaffold` to a `ScreenScaffold` if a `Scaffold` is passed in.
- `ScreenScaffold`: This wraps a `Scaffold` and adds a `GoRouterState`. It is used so that the `Scaffold` can be used within the `GoRouter` navigation system.
- `Copy` interface: This is used to create a copy of the `AdaptiveScrollbarConfig` with some updated values.
- `TransparentPointer`: This is a widget that makes its child transparent to pointer events. It is used here to make the `TrackPlayer` transparent to taps and drags so that when it is invisible, it let's the taps propagate the tree.
- `ScreenWidget.generate`: This is used to generate a `ScreenWidget` with some default configuration. Here it is used to generate the screen widget returned by the builder function with a `ScreenScaffold` and configured `AdaptiveScaffoldConfig`.

#### From `adaptive_scaffold`

- `AdaptiveScrollbarConfig`: This is used to configure scrollbars. Here it is used to connect the `_scrollController` to the scrollbar.

### The `lib/src/widgets/radio/widgets/track_channel.dart` file is using the following features from `utilities`

- The `Base64Image` widget is used to display the channel's image. It loads the image data from a Base64-encoded string and caches the image in the system's `temp` directory.
The `ResizableText` widgets are used to display the channel's title and artist. They resize the text based on the available space.
  - `BodySmall` displays small body text. It is used for the channel title on mobile.
  - `BodyMedium` displays medium-sized body text. It is used for the channel title on desktop, with a max of 2 lines.
  - `LabelExtraSmall` displays extra small label text. It is used for the channel artist on mobile.
  - `LabelNormal` displays normal-sized label text. It is used for the channel artist on desktop, with a max of 2 lines.
These text widgets are used to appropriately size the channel's title and artist for mobile vs desktop, and constrain the text to a maximum of 2 lines on desktop.
